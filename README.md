There are other types of A.I. the more tech-oriented crowd observes. They follow a similar outline but get written about with a stronger foundation in what the A.I. is used for, what it is capable of, and how it helps advance humanity. These three types are:

+ Artificial Narrow Intelligence
+ Artificial General Intelligence
+ Artificial Super Intelligence



**Artificial Narrow Intelligence**
In defining the term Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), it is useful to think of it as all of the artificial intelligence currently in existence and which will be realizable within the foreseeable future. 
The word narrow indicates that the type of intelligence in question only pertains to one domain at a time. For example, a given device or system may be able to play chess, but it will not be able to play another strategy game like Go or shogi, let alone perform completely different tasks such as translation. In short, narrow means both a display of intelligence in the sense of the ability to solve a complex problem and a display of intelligence relative to only one task.

**Artificial General Intelligence**
For Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), the cognitive versatility of a human being is the reference point against which this form of artificial intelligence is measured and judged. 
The goal is not only to replicate specific instances of sensory data interpretation, language interpretation, or other forms of intelligent behavior, but the full range of human cognitive abilities. Clearly, this entails displaying all the capabilities currentlyrepresented by Weak Artificial Intelligence as well as the ability to implement elements of generalization across domain boundariesâ€”that is, implementing things learned in one task to different but related tasks, including motivation and volition. Philosophical sources on the matter (Searle, 1980), in particular, go one step further by also requiring
that AGI possesses consciousness or self-awareness.

It is an exceptionally difficult task to imagine the development of an artificial intelligence device that simultaneously had all of the following abilities:

+ the cognitive ability to learn and function in several domains
+ the possession of human-level intelligence across all domains
+ the possession of multi-domain problem-solving abilities at the average human level
+ independent problem-solving ability
+ the ability to think abstractly without direct reference to past experience 64 Unit 4
+ the ability to perceive the whole environment in which it operates
+ the ability to entertain hypotheticals for which it has no prior experience
+ the ability to motivate itself and the possession of self-awareness

Others forms of AI.

The four A.I. types are

1. Reactive Machines
2. Limited Memory
3. Theory of Mind
4. Self Aware
